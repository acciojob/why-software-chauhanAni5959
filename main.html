	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and creating
    solutions that can make life easier for people. Technology shapes the world around us,
    and being a developer gives me the ability to build tools, websites, and applications
    that can help others, improve efficiency, and even inspire creativity. I am motivated by
    the opportunity to continuously learn new skills, work on exciting projects, and
    contribute to meaningful innovations in the digital world.
